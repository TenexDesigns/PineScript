In Pine Script, functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks or calculations. They allow you to encapsulate logic and reuse it throughout your script, making your code more modular and maintainable.
  Here's a reference manual for some commonly used functions in Pine Script:


**What are Functions?**

- Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
- Can take inputs (arguments) and return outputs.
- Enhance code modularity and readability.

**Function Syntax:**

```pine
<return_type> <function_name>(<argument1>, <argument2>, ...)
```

- `<return_type>`: The type of data the function returns (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`).
- `<function_name>`: The name of the function (e.g., `sma`, `rsi`).
- `<argument1>`, `<argument2>`, ...: Input values passed to the function.

**Most Used Pine Script Functions:**

**1. Technical Analysis:**

- **Moving Averages (`sma`, `ema`, `wma`, etc.)**: Calculate various moving average types (simple, exponential, weighted).
- **Oscillators (`rsi`, `macd`, `stoch`, etc.)**: Measure price momentum and identify potential overbought/oversold conditions.
- **Volatility Indicators (`atr`, `bollingerbands`, `adx`, etc.)**: Assess market volatility and potential breakouts.
- **Volume Functions (`volume`, `volumeosc`, etc.)**: Analyze trading volume for insights on market activity.

**2. Data Manipulation:**

- **`highest`, `lowest`**: Find the highest/lowest value within a specified period.
- **`average`**: Calculate the average of a series of values.
- **`crossover`, `crossunder`**: Check if one series crosses above/below another.
- **`if`, `else`**: Implement conditional logic within your script.

**3. Strategy Development:**

- **`strategy.entry`**: Place entry orders (long or short) based on your strategy's conditions.
- **`strategy.exit`**: Close existing positions based on stop-loss, take-profit, or other exit rules.
- **`strategy.position_size`**: Set or calculate the position size for your trades.
- **`strategy.opentrades`**: Check the number of currently open positions.

**4. Charting and Visualization:**

- **`plot`**: Display lines, bars, or other visual elements on the chart.
- **`hline`, `vline`**: Draw horizontal or vertical lines on the chart.
- **`color`**: Define colors for chart elements.
- **`fill`**: Fill areas between price lines or indicators.

**5. Time and Date:**

- **`time`**: Access the current or historical bar's time in seconds since the epoch.
- **`year`**: Extract the year from a timestamp.
- **`month`**: Extract the month from a timestamp.
- **`dayofweek`**: Determine the day of the week.


### 1. **Built-in Functions**:
   - **ta**: Provides access to built-in technical analysis functions. Example: `ta.sma()`, `ta.rsi()`, `ta.ema()`.
   - **math**: Provides access to built-in mathematical functions. Example: `math.abs()`, `math.log()`, `math.pow()`.
   - **strategy**: Provides access to strategy-related functions. Example: `strategy.entry()`, `strategy.exit()`, `strategy.close()`.

### 2. **Plotting Functions**:
   - **plot()**: Plots data on the chart. Example: `plot(close)`, `plot(sma, color=color.blue)`.
   - **line.new()**: Draws lines on the chart. Example: `line.new(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

### 3. **Input Functions**:
   - **input()**: Defines script inputs that can be adjusted by users. Example: `input.int()`, `input.bool()`, `input.color()`.

### 4. **Array Functions**:
   - **array**: Provides functions for working with arrays. Example: `array.size()`, `array.get()`.

### 5. **Series Functions**:
   - **series**: Provides functions for working with time-series data. Example: `series.high()`, `series.low()`.



  
### User-Defined Functions

Pine Script also allows users to define their own functions, which can be particularly useful for encapsulating complex calculations or logic that needs to be reused across a script. User-defined functions can be single-line or multi-line, and they can return multiple results.

#### Single-Line Functions

Single-line functions are concise and can be defined in one line. They are useful for simple calculations or operations.

```pinescript
//@version=5
geom_average(x, y) => math.sqrt(x*x + y*y)
```

#### Multi-Line Functions

Multi-line functions allow for more complex logic and calculations, with the function body consisting of multiple statements.

```pinescript
//@version=5
geom_average(x, y) =>
    a = x*x
    b = y*y
    math.sqrt(a + b)
```

### Limitations

- User-defined functions cannot use certain built-in functions like `plot()`, `plotshape()`, `plotarrow()`, `strategy()`, and others that are specific to the script's execution context.
- Functions cannot be embedded within other functions or blocks.
- Functions do not support recursion, meaning a function cannot call itself.
- The return type of a function is automatically determined based on the last value in the function's body.

Understanding these built-in and user-defined functions is crucial for effectively using Pine Script to analyze market data and make informed trading decisions. The Pine Script v5 User Manual and Language Reference Manual provide comprehensive information on all built-in functions and the rules for defining user-defined functions, making them essential tools for both beginners and experienced Pine Script users [1].




  

### Most Used Functions:
  
   - **ta.sma()**: Calculates the simple moving average.
   - **ta.ema()**: Calculates the exponential moving average.
   - **ta.rsi()**: Calculates the Relative Strength Index.
   - **plot()**: Plots data on the chart.
   - **strategy.entry()**: Executes entry orders for trading strategies.
