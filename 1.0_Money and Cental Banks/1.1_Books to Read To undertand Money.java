What you're describing is the concept of fractional reserve banking, where banks are only required to hold a fraction of their customers' deposits as reserves and can lend out the rest.

There are some misconceptions about how money is created and circulated in the modern economy. Here's a breakdown of your points and some resources to learn more:

**Money Creation:**

* **Federal Reserve:** In the US, the Federal Reserve, the central bank, is primarily responsible for creating money, not commercial banks. They do this through various methods, including buying government bonds and setting reserve requirements for banks. 
* **Fractional Reserve Banking:**  Commercial banks can create credit, which acts like money, through fractional-reserve banking. They lend out a portion of customer deposits, expanding the money supply. However, they don't simply create money out of thin air. They are limited by the reserve requirement set by the central bank. 

**Debt and Money Supply:**

* **Debt doesn't directly equal money:** While debt can influence the money supply, it's not the sole factor. Banks can't simply create unlimited loans without any reserves.
* **Loan Repayment:** When you repay a loan, the money doesn't disappear. It goes back into the bank's reserves and can be used to lend to others.

**Further Points:**

* **Real Estate:** Real estate is a significant asset class in the economy, but it's not the only factor driving money creation. 
* **Debt can be risky:** While debt can play a role in economic growth, excessive debt can also lead to financial instability.

Remember, the financial system is complex. These resources provide a starting point to gain a better understanding of how money creation and fractional-reserve banking work.
