In Pine Script, identifiers are names given to user-defined variables and functions. They follow specific rules regarding their composition and usage. Here are some guidelines for working with identifiers in Pine Script, along with code samples:

### Rules for Identifiers:
1. **Composition**: Identifiers can be composed of lowercase and uppercase letters from the English alphabet, numbers, and underscores ('_').
2. **Start**: An identifier cannot begin with a number. It must start with a letter or an underscore.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Pine Script is case-sensitive, meaning that lowercase and uppercase symbols are treated differently.
4. **Examples**: Valid identifiers can include names like `myVar`, `_myVar`, `my123Var`, `MAX_LEN`, and `max_len`.

### Do's and Don'ts:
- **Do** use descriptive and meaningful names for your identifiers to enhance readability and understanding of your script.
- **Do** follow a consistent naming convention for variables and functions throughout your script.
- **Do** use camelCase or snake_case for multi-word identifiers, depending on your preference or the convention followed.
- **Don't** use reserved words or predefined names in Pine Script, as they may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
- **Don't** use special characters other than underscore ('_') in identifiers, as they are not allowed.

### Code Samples:
```pinescript
// Valid identifiers
myVar = 10
_myVar = 20
my123Var = 30
MAX_LEN = 50
max_len = 60

// Invalid identifiers (will result in syntax errors)
// 123Var = 40  // Identifier cannot begin with a number
// special-char = 70  // Special characters other than underscore are not allowed
```

By following these rules and best practices for identifiers in Pine Script, you can create well-structured and readable scripts that are easier to maintain and understand.
