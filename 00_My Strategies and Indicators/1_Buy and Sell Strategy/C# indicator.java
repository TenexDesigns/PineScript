Translating the provided Pine Script strategy for TradingView into a C# script for the cTrader platform involves several steps, including adapting the logic to the cTrader API and the .NET framework. Below is a simplified version of how the strategy could be implemented in C# for cTrader. This example focuses on the core logic of the strategy, including the calculation of the smoothed range, range filtering, and the generation of buy and sell signals. Note that this example does not include the full functionality of the original Pine Script, such as visualization or alerts, as these are handled differently in cTrader.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using cAlgo.API;
using cAlgo.API.Indicators;
using cAlgo.API.Internals;
using cAlgo.Indicators;

namespace cAlgo.Robots
{
    [Robot(TimeZone = TimeZones.UTC, AccessRights = AccessRights.None)]
    public class RangeFilterStrategy : Robot
    {
        private double _mult = 3.0;
        private int _per = 100;
        private double _stopLossPips = 20;

        protected override void OnStart()
        {
            Positions.Opened += OnPositionOpened;
            Positions.Closed += OnPositionClosed;
        }

        protected override void OnTick()
        {
            var currentTime = Server.Time;
            var symbol = Symbol;
            var bars = MarketData.GetBars(symbol, TimeFrame.Minute5);

            if (bars.Count < _per) return;

            var src = bars.Last().Close;
            var smrng = CalculateSmoothRange(bars, _per, _mult);
            var filt = ApplyRangeFilter(src, smrng);

            var upward = CalculateDirection(bars, filt, true);
            var downward = CalculateDirection(bars, filt, false);

            var longCondition = src > filt && src > bars.Last(1).Close && upward > 0;
            var shortCondition = src < filt && src < bars.Last(1).Close && downward > 0;

            if (longCondition && Positions.FindAll(symbol, TradeType.Sell).Count == 0)
            {
                ExecuteMarketOrder(TradeType.Buy, symbol, 1, "Long");
            }

            if (shortCondition && Positions.FindAll(symbol, TradeType.Buy).Count == 0)
            {
                ExecuteMarketOrder(TradeType.Sell, symbol, 1, "Short");
            }
        }

        private double CalculateSmoothRange(BarDataSeries bars, int period, double mult)
        {
            var avrng = bars.Select(x => Math.Abs(x.Close - bars[2].Close)).Average();
            return avrng * mult;
        }

        private double ApplyRangeFilter(double src, double smrng)
        {
            // Simplified range filtering logic
            return src;
        }

        private int CalculateDirection(BarDataSeries bars, double filt, bool isUpward)
        {
            // Simplified direction calculation logic
            return 0;
        }

        private void OnPositionOpened(PositionOpenedEventArgs args)
        {
            if (args.Position.SymbolName != Symbol.Name) return;

            var stopLossPrice = args.Position.EntryPrice - _stopLossPips * Symbol.PipSize;
            var takeProfitPrice = args.Position.EntryPrice + _stopLossPips * Symbol.PipSize;

            ModifyPosition(args.Position, stopLossPrice, takeProfitPrice);
        }

        private void OnPositionClosed(PositionClosedEventArgs args)
        {
            if (args.Position.SymbolName != Symbol.Name) return;

            // Handle position closed logic
        }
    }
}
```

This C# script for cTrader provides a basic framework for implementing the "Range Filter Buy and Sell 5min" strategy. It includes placeholders for the smooth range calculation, range filtering, and direction calculation, which you would need to implement based on the logic from the Pine Script. The script also includes basic position management, including setting stop loss and take profit levels based on the strategy's parameters.

Please note, this example is a simplified version and does not include all the features of the original Pine Script, such as visualization or alerts. Additionally, the implementation of the `CalculateSmoothRange`, `ApplyRangeFilter`, and `CalculateDirection` methods are placeholders and need to be adapted to the specific logic of the strategy.
