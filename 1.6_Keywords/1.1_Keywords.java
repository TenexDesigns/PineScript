## Pine Script Keywords: Building Blocks of Your Scripts

Pine Script, like other programming languages, utilizes keywords to define essential elements that control the flow and behavior of your code. Understanding these keywords is crucial for writing effective and efficient scripts.

**What are Keywords?**

- Reserved words with specific meanings within the language.
- Cannot be used for variable names, function names, or other custom identifiers.

**Most Used Pine Script Keywords:**

**1. Data Types:**

- `int`: Denotes integer (whole number) values.
- `float`: Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal precision).
- `bool`: Used for Boolean values (true or false).
- `string`: Defines a sequence of characters (text).
- `color`: Represents color values for chart elements.
- `series`: Denotes a series of data points (e.g., prices, indicator values).

**2. Variables:**

- `var`: Declares a variable to store data during script execution.

**3. Operators:**

- **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo)
- **Comparison:** `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical:** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Assignment:** `=`

**4. Control Flow:**

- `if`, `else`: Implement conditional statements for branching logic.
- `for`: Create loops for repeating a block of code.
- `while`: Execute code as long as a condition is true.

**5. Functions:**

- Function calls to execute built-in or custom functions.

**6. Script Structure:**

- `//@version`: Specify the Pine Script version your script is designed for.
- `indicator`: Defines an indicator script for visual analysis.
- `strategy`: Creates a strategy script for automated trading decisions.

**7. Other Commonly Used Keywords:**

- `const`: Defines a constant value that cannot be changed during script execution.
- `input`: Allows user input for parameters within the script.
- `plot`: Creates visual elements on the chart.
- `fillna`: Replaces missing data points (`na`) with a specified value.
- `na`: Represents "not available" or missing data.

**Additional Tips:**

- Pine Script's online documentation provides a comprehensive list of keywords with detailed explanations and examples. ([https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/index.html](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/index.html))
- The code editor's IntelliSense feature offers keyword suggestions and syntax highlighting.
- Familiarize yourself with common keywords to write clear and structured Pine Script code.

**By understanding Pine Script keywords, you gain the power to control the flow of your scripts, perform calculations, and build sophisticated technical analysis tools or trading strategies. Remember, practice and experiment with these keywords to refine your Pine Script skills.**

  In Pine Script, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and functionalities within the language. They are used to define the structure, logic, and behavior of your script. Here's a reference manual for some commonly used keywords in Pine Script:

### 1. **Structure Keywords**:
   - **study**: Marks the beginning of an indicator script. Example: `study("My Indicator")`.
   - **strategy**: Marks the beginning of a strategy script. Example: `strategy("My Strategy")`.

### 2. **Variable Keywords**:
   - **var**: Declares variables within the script. Example: `var float myVariable = 10.5`.
   - **input**: Declares inputs that can be adjusted by users. Example: `input.int("Length", 14)`.

### 3. **Conditional Keywords**:
   - **if**, **else if**, **else**: Used for conditional execution of code blocks. Example:
     ```pinescript
     if (condition) {
         // Code block to execute if condition is true
     } else {
         // Code block to execute if condition is false
     }
     ```

### 4. **Looping Keywords**:
   - **for**: Used for iterating over a range of values. Example:
     ```pinescript
     for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
         // Code block to execute in each iteration
     }
     ```

### 5. **Function Keywords**:
   - **function**: Defines custom functions within the script. Example:
     ```pinescript
     function myFunction(arg1, arg2) {
         // Code block of the function
     }
     ```

### 6. **Execution Keywords**:
   - **return**: Exits a function and returns a value. Example: `return result`.
   - **break**: Exits a loop prematurely. Example: `if (condition) break`.

### Most Used Keywords:
   - **study**: Marks the beginning of an indicator script.
   - **strategy**: Marks the beginning of a strategy script.
   - **var**: Declares variables within the script.
   - **input**: Declares inputs that can be adjusted by users.
   - **if**, **else if**, **else**: Used for conditional execution of code blocks.
   - **for**: Used for iterating over a range of values.

These keywords are fundamental to the structure and behavior of Pine Script. Understanding how to use them effectively enables you to create well-structured, functional, and expressive scripts for technical analysis and trading strategy development on the TradingView platform.

  Pine Script, the programming language used on TradingView, offers a wide range of keywords that are essential for writing scripts for both indicators and strategies. These keywords are fundamental to the language and are used to define the structure, logic, and behavior of your scripts. Here's an overview of some of the most commonly used keywords in Pine Script, as detailed in the Pine Script v5 User Manual and Language Reference Manual:

### Keywords

- **`study`**: Used at the beginning of an indicator script to define it as an indicator. It specifies the properties of the indicator, such as its title, short title, overlay, and other settings.
- **`strategy`**: Used at the beginning of a strategy script to define it as a strategy. It specifies the properties of the strategy, such as its title, short title, overlay, and other settings.
- **`input`**: Used to define input variables that can be set by the user in the settings panel of the script.
- **`var`**: Used to declare variables that retain their value between script executions.
- **`if`**: Used for conditional statements to execute code based on certain conditions.
- **`else`**: Used in conjunction with `if` to specify an alternative block of code to be executed if the condition in the `if` statement is not met.
- **`for`**: Used to create a loop that executes a block of code a specified number of times.
- **`while`**: Used to create a loop that executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- **`plot`**: Used to plot a series on the chart.
- **`plotshape`**: Used to plot shapes on the chart based on certain conditions.
- **`plotarrow`**: Used to plot arrows on the chart based on certain conditions.
- **`line.new`**: Used to draw lines on the chart.
- **`label.new`**: Used to create text labels on the chart.
- **`security`**: Used to request data from different symbols or timeframes.
- **`strategy.entry`**: Used in strategy scripts to place an entry order.
- **`strategy.exit`**: Used in strategy scripts to place an exit order.
- **`strategy.order`**: Used in strategy scripts to place an order with more control over the order parameters.

### Most Used Keywords

- **`study`** and **`strategy`**: These are the starting points for any Pine Script. They define the script type and set up the script's properties.
- **`input`**: Essential for creating customizable scripts. It allows users to set parameters for the script.
- **`var`** and **`if`**: Used extensively for defining variables and implementing logic based on conditions.
- **`plot`**, **`plotshape`**, and **`plotarrow`**: These are used for visualizing data on the chart, making it easier to interpret the script's output.

Understanding these keywords is crucial for effectively using Pine Script to analyze market data and make informed trading decisions. The Pine Script v5 User Manual and Language Reference Manual provide comprehensive information on all keywords and their usage, making them essential tools for both beginners and experienced Pine Script users [2][3][4].
