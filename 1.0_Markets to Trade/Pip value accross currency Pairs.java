The pip value is not constant across all currency pairs because it depends on several factors, including the exchange rate of the currency pair, the lot size traded, and the quote currency of the trading account. However, we can estimate the pip value for a 0.1 lot size across the currency pairs you provided, assuming a USD-denominated trading account. Here's an estimation:

1. **EUR/USD**: Approximately $1 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
2. **GBP/USD**: Approximately $1.25 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
3. **USD/JPY**: Approximately $0.90 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
4. **USD/CHF**: Approximately $1.10 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
5. **USD/CAD**: Approximately $0.90 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
6. **AUD/USD**: Approximately $0.90 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
7. **NZD/USD**: Approximately $0.80 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
8. **GBP/JPY**: Approximately $1.50 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
9. **XAU/USD (Gold/USD)**: Pip value varies due to the price of gold. Estimated around $0.10 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.
10. **USD/MXN**: Pip value varies due to the exchange rate of USD/MXN. Estimated around $0.80 per pip for a 0.1 lot size.

For other currency pairs not mentioned in your list, you can estimate the pip value using a similar approach. Remember that these are rough estimations, and actual pip values may vary slightly depending on market conditions and your broker's specific pricing. It's always a good idea to double-check with your broker or use a pip value calculator for precise calculations.
