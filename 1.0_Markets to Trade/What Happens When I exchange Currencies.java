When you make a purchase in a foreign currency like USD (United States Dollar) using your Kenyan Shillings (KES), the conversion process typically involves several steps and entities:

1. **Payment Processor**: When you make a purchase online with your debit card, the payment is processed through a payment gateway or processor. This processor communicates with your bank to authorize the transaction.

2. **Currency Conversion**: Your bank converts your KES into USD at the prevailing exchange rate. This conversion may happen instantly or may take some time, depending on the bank's processes.

3. **Interbank Market**: Your bank likely accesses the interbank foreign exchange market to obtain USD. The interbank market is where banks and financial institutions trade currencies among themselves. Banks buy and sell currencies based on their customers' needs and market conditions.

4. **Foreign Exchange Reserves**: The bank may use its foreign exchange reserves to fulfill the currency conversion. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by central banks and monetary authorities, typically in the form of foreign currencies, to support the country's currency and manage exchange rate stability.

5. **Central Bank**: In some cases, especially for large transactions or when there are fluctuations in exchange rates, banks may need to access USD directly from the central bank. Central banks play a role in managing exchange rates and may intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the currency or influence its value.

6. **Exchange Rates**: Exchange rates are determined by supply and demand dynamics in the foreign exchange market. Factors such as economic indicators, interest rates, inflation, geopolitical events, and market sentiment influence exchange rates. Central banks may also influence exchange rates through monetary policy actions or interventions in the currency market.

For businesses engaging in international trade, the process is similar. When a company in the USA conducts business with a company in China, it may need to exchange USD for Chinese Yuan (CNY) to facilitate transactions. This exchange typically occurs through banks or foreign exchange markets.

In summary, the conversion of currencies involves multiple parties, including banks, payment processors, and central banks. The process ensures that you can make purchases in foreign currencies while managing exchange rate risk and maintaining currency stability.

  Here's how Kenyan shillings are converted to USD when you buy something online:

**The Conversion Process:**

1. **Payment Processor:** When you use your Kenyan debit card on Amazon or Netflix, the transaction goes through a payment processor. This is a service that handles online payments securely.
2. **Currency Conversion:** The payment processor uses the current exchange rate to convert your Kenyan shillings to USD. They might charge a small fee for this conversion.
3. **Local Bank:** The payment processor contacts your Kenyan bank.
4. **Shillings Deducted:** Your Kenyan bank deducts the equivalent amount in shillings from your account based on the conversion rate and any fees.
5. **USD Sent to Seller:** The payment processor then sends the converted USD amount to the seller's account (Amazon or Netflix in this case).

**Your Kenyan Shillings & Local Bank Reserves:**

* Your Kenyan shillings stay within Kenya's banking system. They are not physically transferred to the US.
* Local banks hold reserves of various currencies, including USD, to facilitate these transactions. These reserves might fluctuate slightly based on overall demand.

**Foreign Exchange Market & Businesses:**

* Companies like those in the US needing to pay Chinese companies exchange their USD for Yuan through the foreign exchange market (forex market).
* The forex market is a vast network of banks and institutions electronically trading currencies. It's not a physical location.
* Businesses can exchange currency directly with other businesses or through forex brokers. Central banks sometimes participate to influence exchange rates.

**Floating Exchange Rates & What Affects Them:**

* Exchange rates are constantly changing based on supply and demand for each currency.
* Factors affecting exchange rates include:
    * **Supply and Demand:** High demand for a currency increases its value.
    * **Interest Rates:** Higher interest rates in a country attract investment, strengthening its currency.
    * **Inflation:** Inflation erodes a currency's buying power, weakening it.
    * **Economic Stability:** A strong, stable economy makes its currency more attractive.
    * **Political Events:** Political instability can weaken a currency.

**Central Banks & Exchange Rates:**

* Central banks can indirectly influence exchange rates through monetary policy tools like interest rates.
* They can also directly intervene in the forex market by buying or selling their own currency to stabilize it.

**In summary:**

* Online transactions involve currency conversion at the current exchange rate by payment processors.
* Local banks handle the conversion within Kenya's banking system.
* Businesses exchange currencies through the forex market, which is influenced by supply, demand, and various economic factors. Central banks can play a role in influencing exchange rates.
