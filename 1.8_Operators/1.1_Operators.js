In Pine Script, operators are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands. They are used to manipulate values, compare data, and perform mathematical calculations. Understanding the different operators available in Pine Script is essential for writing efficient and expressive scripts. Here's a reference manual for some commonly used operators:

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - **+**: Addition. Example: `result = a + b;`
   - **-**: Subtraction. Example: `result = a - b;`
   - **\***: Multiplication. Example: `result = a * b;`
   - **/**: Division. Example: `result = a / b;`
   - **%**: Modulus (remainder). Example: `result = a % b;`

### 2. **Comparison Operators**:
   - **==**: Equal to. Example: `isEqual = a == b;`
   - **!=**: Not equal to. Example: `isNotEqual = a != b;`
   - **>**: Greater than. Example: `isGreater = a > b;`
   - **<**: Less than. Example: `isLess = a < b;`
   - **>=**: Greater than or equal to. Example: `isGreaterOrEqual = a >= b;`
   - **<=**: Less than or equal to. Example: `isLessOrEqual = a <= b;`

### 3. **Logical Operators**:
   - **&&**: Logical AND. Example: `isTrue = condition1 && condition2;`
   - **||**: Logical OR. Example: `isTrue = condition1 || condition2;`
   - **!**: Logical NOT. Example: `isFalse = !condition;`

### 4. **Assignment Operators**:
   - **=**: Assigns a value to a variable. Example: `myVariable = value;`
   - **+=**: Adds and assigns. Example: `myVariable += value;`
   - **-=**: Subtracts and assigns. Example: `myVariable -= value;`
   - **\*=**: Multiplies and assigns. Example: `myVariable *= value;`
   - **/=**: Divides and assigns. Example: `myVariable /= value;`

### 5. **Conditional Operator**:
   - **? :**: Ternary conditional operator. Example: `result = condition ? value1 : value2;`

### Most Used Operators:
   - **+**, **-**, **\***, **/**: Arithmetic operators for mathematical calculations.
   - **==**, **!=**, **>**, **<**, **>=**, **<=**: Comparison operators for comparing values.
   - **&&**, **||**, **!**: Logical operators for combining conditions.
   - **=**: Assignment operator for assigning values to variables.

These operators are fundamental to performing various operations and comparisons in Pine Script. Understanding how to use them effectively allows you to write concise, readable, and efficient scripts for technical analysis and trading strategy development on the TradingView platform.

  ## Pine Script Operators: The Tools for Data Manipulation

Operators in Pine Script are symbols that perform various actions on data or control the flow of your scripts. Understanding these operators is crucial for crafting efficient and accurate technical indicators and trading strategies.

**Most Used Pine Script Operators:**

**1. Arithmetic Operators:**

   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)
   - `%` (Modulo - remainder after division)

   **Example:** `close - open + (high - low) / 2` (calculates the average true range)

**2. Comparison Operators:**

   - `==` (Equal to)
   - `!=` (Not equal to)
   - `<` (Less than)
   - `>` (Greater than)
   - `<=` (Less than or equal to)
   - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)

   **Example:** `close > sma(close, 20)` (checks if price is above its 20-period moving average)

**3. Logical Operators:**

   - `&&` (AND) - Both conditions must be true for the expression to be true.
   - `||` (OR) - Either condition can be true for the expression to be true.
   - `!` (NOT) - Inverts the logical state of a condition.

   **Example:** `(crossover(macd, signal) && rsi < 70)` (checks for a MACD crossover and RSI below 70)

**4. Assignment Operator:**

   - `=` - Assigns a value to a variable.

   **Example:** `ma_value = sma(close, 20)` (stores the moving average value in a variable)

**5. Increment/Decrement Operators (less common):**

   - `++` (Increment - adds 1)
   - `--` (Decrement - subtracts 1)

   **Example:** `bar_index++` (increments the bar index by 1)

**Additional Considerations:**

- Pine Script follows operator precedence (order of operations), so complex expressions are evaluated correctly. Use parentheses if needed.
- The `?:` ternary operator provides a concise way to express conditional assignments.

**Example (Ternary Operator):**

```pine
long_condition = close > crossover(macd, signal);
entry_price = long_condition ? close + 2 * atr : na;
```

**In Conclusion:**

Pine Script operators are fundamental building blocks for calculations, comparisons, and controlling script logic. Master these operators to manipulate data effectively, construct clear expressions, and create sophisticated trading tools. Remember, practice writing Pine Script code to solidify your understanding of operators and their applications.

  Pine Script, the programming language used on TradingView, offers a variety of operators that allow you to perform operations on variables and values. These operators are essential for creating complex expressions and controlling the flow of your scripts. Here's an overview of the most commonly used operators in Pine Script, as detailed in the Pine Script v5 User Manual and Language Reference Manual:

### Arithmetic Operators

- **`+`**: Addition
- **`-`**: Subtraction
- **`*`**: Multiplication
- **`/`**: Division
- **`%`**: Modulus (remainder of division)

### Comparison Operators

- **`==`**: Equal to
- **`!=`**: Not equal to
- **`>`**: Greater than
- **`<`**: Less than
- **`>=`**: Greater than or equal to
- **`<=`**: Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators

- **`and`**: Logical AND
- **`or`**: Logical OR
- **`not`**: Logical NOT

### Ternary Operator

- **`?:`**: Conditional operator, used to select one of two values based on a condition.

### History-referencing Operator

- **`[ ]`**: Used to reference historical values of a series.

### Assignment Operators

- **`=`**: Assigns a value to a variable.
- **`:=`**: Reassigns a value to a variable, typically used with `var` variables to update their value.

### Example Usage

Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of some of these operators in a Pine Script:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Operators Example")

// Arithmetic operators
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2
remainder = num1 % num2

// Comparison operators
isEqual = num1 == num2
isNotEqual = num1 != num2
isGreater = num1 > num2
isLess = num1 < num2

// Logical operators
isTrue = true and false
isFalse = true or false
isNegated = not true

// Ternary operator
result = isTrue ? "True" : "False"

// History-referencing operator
prevClose = close[2]

// Assignment operators
num1 := 20
sum := sum + num1

plot(sum, title="Sum", color=color.red)
```

Understanding these operators is crucial for writing effective Pine Script scripts. They allow you to perform calculations, compare values, and control the flow of your scripts based on conditions. The Pine Script v5 User Manual and Language Reference Manual provide comprehensive information on all operators, making them essential tools for both beginners and experienced Pine Script users [1][5].
