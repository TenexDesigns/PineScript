The type system in Pine Script defines the basic types of data that can be used in scripts and how they behave. Here's an overview of the types and their usage:

### 1. **Series Type**:
   - The primary type of data in Pine Script is a series, which represents a list of values over time.
   - Examples of built-in series variables include `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `volume`.
   - Series variables have a size equal to the quantity of available bars based on the current ticker and timeframe (resolution).
   - Series can contain numbers or a special value `NaN` (meaning 'absence of value').
   - Any expression that contains a series variable will be treated as a series itself.

### 2. **Numeric Types**:
   - Pine Script has two types to represent numbers: integer and float.
   - The result of an arithmetic expression containing only numbers will be a number itself.

### 3. **String Type**:
   - The `string` type is used for indicators' names, inputs, line graphs, ticker names, resolutions, trade sessions, etc.

### 4. **Boolean Type**:
   - Pine Script has a `bool` type with two built-in constants: `true` and `false`.
   - Numeric types can be automatically converted to a logical type; `0` or `na` are false, and the rest are true.

### 5. **Color Type**:
   - Pine Script has a `color` type used for configuring color values.
   - There are built-in variables for basic colors such as black, red, green, blue, etc.

### 6. **Object Types**:
   - Certain function annotations return values representing objects created on the chart.
   - For example, the `plot` function returns an object of type `plot`, represented as a line or diagram on the chart.
   - Similarly, the `hline` function returns an object of type `hline`, represented as a horizontal line.

The type system in Pine Script ensures that data is handled appropriately and allows for the creation of complex indicators and strategies. By understanding the types available and how they behave, script authors can effectively utilize Pine Script to perform technical analysis and develop trading strategies on the TradingView platform.
