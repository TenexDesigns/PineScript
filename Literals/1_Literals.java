In Pine Script, literals are fixed values assigned with immediate values, such as numbers, strings, boolean values, and color values, which may not be altered by the script. Here are examples and explanations of different types of literals with code samples:

### 1. **Integer Literals**:
   - Integral-valued literals are presented only in the decimal system.
   - Examples:
     ```pinescript
     1
     750
     94572
     100
     ```

### 2. **Floating-Point Literals**:
   - Real literals contain a delimiter ('.') and/or the symbol 'e' (for scientific notation).
   - Examples:
     ```pinescript
     3.14159 // Pi (Ï€)
     6.02e23 // Avogadro's number
     1.6e-19 // Planck's constant
     3.0
     ```

### 3. **Boolean Literals**:
   - There are two literals for representing logical values: `true` and `false`.
   - Examples:
     ```pinescript
     true
     false
     ```

### 4. **String Literals**:
   - String literals may be enclosed by single or double quotation marks.
   - Examples:
     ```pinescript
     "This is a double quoted string literal"
     'This is a single quoted string literal'
     "It's an example"
     'The "Star" indicator'
     ```

### 5. **Color Literals**:
   - Color literals have the format '#RRGGBB', where RR represents the red color component, GG represents the green color component, and BB represents the blue color component, all in hexadecimal format.
   - Examples:
     ```pinescript
     #000000 // Black color
     #FF0000 // Red color
     #00FF00 // Green color
     #0000FF // Blue color
     #FFFFFF // White color
     #808080 // Gray color
     #3ff7a0 // Custom color
     ```

### Note:
- It's possible to use uppercase "E" instead of lowercase "e" in floating-point literals for scientific notation.
- When using hexadecimal figures for color literals, it's possible to use them in either upper or lowercase.

These literals are essential building blocks in Pine Script for representing various types of data, from numerical values to colors, and are used extensively in writing indicators and strategies on the TradingView platform.
